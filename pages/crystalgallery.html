            Crystal Gallery was established by Vaclav Jirasek(Wes) on October in 1996. Our first store was located at famous Lonsdale Quay Market in Noth Vancouver. After 15 years in 2012 we moved to Metropolis in Burnaby. In 2014 we moved to 5067 ANOLA Drive in Burnaby - existing location.
            Vaclav Jirasek(Wes) is passionate about art glassware especially crystal glass cut by hand from Czech Republic but lately we are selling the glass product from around the world.
